The recently released guidance from the CWCB provides the critical foundation for an emerging science of Fluvial Hazard Zone prediction. A pilot study is also underway to map FHZs for a small number of rivers on Colorado's Front Range. This author wholely supports the adoption and implementation of this expert-based approach to identifying unmapped fluvial hazards. However, the need is great and progress in mapping individual rivers will take years if not decades. This raises an important question:

- Are there methods that can extend the CWCB's Fluvial Hazard Zone mapping efforts?

The availability, level of detail, and abundance of predictive data from before and after the 2013 floods provides the opportunity to apply a new set of tools to the problem.

- What additional insights can the 2013 flood provide for hazard mitigation purposes?

This project will explore the ability of MACHINE LEARNING and ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ALGORITHMS to predict the 2013 flood impacts (FHZs specifically) using 2011 data. While this exploration is in its early stages, the results show promise. Although this effort is isolated from the CWCB's current efforts, future integration of these methods is both possible and mutually beneficial. The algorithms could be improved with expert-level guidance, and CWCB's pilot study could be scaled up to the many stream miles where people live in harm's way.
